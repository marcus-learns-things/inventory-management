## Project Goals
### Project Description:
Our team's project was to originally design a secure inventory store management system application using C#, .NET Core, WPF, and MSSQL. A windows application that could store and manage data simulating a store's inventory. Using the application we built, we would try and analyze possible security faults that could be ascertained during development.
However, due to project time constraints and some glaring issues faced, we have decided to make some slight adjustments to the technologies we will be using. We have opted out of using the previous technologies entirely and have decided to use Python, HTML/CSS, SQLite, WTForms, Bcrypt, and Flask. This has allowed us to rapidly speed up our development of the project in order to meet our deadlines on time. We will still be pursuing our goals in analyzing security faults of an application like this, but our technologies and milestones have changed.
